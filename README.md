## Multimodal-Data-Extraction-for-AI-Applications-using-Python

This repository demonstrates how to extract and process multimodal data (video, audio, images, and text) from YouTube videos for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. The code allows you to:

Download and trim YouTube videos.

Extract audio from video files.

Convert video into frames (images) for further analysis.

Transcribe audio to text using OpenAI's Whisper.

With this setup, you can create AI-powered applications for speech coaching, body language analysis, or any task that requires the processing of multimodal data. The script uses Python libraries such as yt-dlp, moviepy, ffmpeg, and transformers to perform these tasks. GPU support is also included for faster processing.
